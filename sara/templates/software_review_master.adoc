== Purpose and scope

The purpose of this document is to describe the results obtained in the software quality analysis and code inspection of the {LONG_DESCRIPTION} software product.


First objective is to HELP the development team. +
Please contribute to improve this report. +
Any comments, ideas are welcome !

Other objectives are:

* Deliver a Quality status on the code;
* Communicate it to the code authors, the whole development team and managers;
* Possibly set-up action plan for improvement.


For each of the measurements, we cover the following items:

* What is measured and why;
* The measurement tool(s) used;
* The measurement results;
* An analysis of the results and, potentially, actions to be carried out.

The conclusions are derived from good practices and should be taken as a guide instead of a prescription.

__This analysis has been done without knowledge (science, SW implementationâ€¦) on this project. Please do not hesitate to mention any error or misunderstanding.__


[IMPORTANT]

Feedback from the development team would be very appreciated.
